# Project-IM01
This project was part of the final evaluation for the "Introduction to Image Processing" course as part of the IMAGE study track at Télécom Paris.

In this work, we try to segment the left ventricle structure from various MRI images. The approach consisted in firstly identifying the left ventricle (LV) itself in the image and then segmenting. Then, the initial segmentation was propagate in space (consisting a 3D image), as well as in time (3D+t images). 

All details are carefully detailed in the report file.
